### Codebase Analysis

1.  **Bug Identification:**

    *   **File:** `app/celery/celery.py`

        ```python
        @celery_app.task
        def finalize_challenges():
            try:
                headers = {
                    'X-API-Key': API_KEY,
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
                }
                response = requests.post(url=BASE_URL, headers=headers)
                response.raise_for_status()  # Check for successful response
                print("Challenges finalized successfully")
            except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
                print(f"Error finalizing challenges: {e}")

        # Schedule the task to run every 30 minutes
        celery_app.conf.beat_schedule = {
            'finalize-challenges-every-30-minutes': {
                'task': 'tasks.finalize_challenges',
                'schedule': 30 * 60,  # 30 minutes in seconds
            },
        }
        ```

        **Problem:** In the `celery_app.conf.beat_schedule`, the task name is specified as `tasks.finalize_challenges`. However, the `@celery_app.task` decorator implicitly registers the task under the module it is defined in, in this case, `app.celery.celery`. Therefore, the task name in `beat_schedule` should be `app.celery.celery.finalize_challenges`. Without the correct task name, the scheduled task will not be executed.

    *   **File:** `alembic/versions/ce3ca30a6baa_added_encryption.py` and `alembic/versions/15436d808394_updated_encryption_models.py`
        **Problem:** In version `ce3ca30a6baa`, the table `encrypted_keys` is created with columns `public_key` and `encrypted_private_key`. In version `15436d808394`, these columns are removed and `aes_encrypted_private_key` and `aes_key` are added. However, there's no check in `15436d808394` to ensure the existing data is migrated correctly. This could lead to data loss during the upgrade process if the migration is run on a database with existing data.

    *   **File:** `app/prompts/routes.py`

        ```python
        @router.put("/prompts/{prompt_id}/grant_access")
        async def grant_access_to_prompt(prompt_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_session)):  # Use your existing get_session dependency
            """
            Grants access to a premium prompt by setting grant_access to True.
            """

            prompt = await db.query(models.Prompt).filter(models.Prompt.id == prompt_id).first()

            if not prompt:
                raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Prompt not found")

            if prompt.prompt_type != models.PromptTypeEnum.PREMIUM:
                raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Prompt is not a premium prompt")

            prompt.grant_access = True
            await db.commit()

            return {"message": "Access granted to prompt"}
        ```

        **Problem:** There are two potential issues here. First, the db.query is not awaited and `await db.commit()` is called. Secondly, the prompt update is not followed by a `db.refresh(prompt)` call.

2.  **Comprehensiveness/Completeness Analysis:**

    The codebase appears to be a fairly complete implementation of a social feed platform with premium content, user statistics, and basic account functionalities.  It includes API endpoints for creating, retrieving, liking, commenting, and following content. There's support for user authentication and authorization (via API keys and potentially JWT, although JWT usage isn't fully fleshed out).  Alembic is used for database migrations.  Celery is integrated for asynchronous tasks.  There are routes and models defined for prompt encryption, implying some form of content protection. Tests are present (locustfile) for load testing, which is a good sign.

    However, several areas could be improved:

    *   **Error Handling:** While many routes include try-except blocks, the error handling is generic. More specific exception handling and logging would be beneficial.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** The codebase relies on an `X-API-Key` for Celery. Properly implementing JWT-based authentication and authorization for API endpoints would enhance security. The implementation also has some inconsistencies in how sessions are managed, using both `get_session` and `get_db`.
    *   **Input Validation:** While Pydantic models are used, more explicit input validation, especially for fields like account addresses, could improve robustness.
    *   **Testing:** The `locustfile.py` provides load testing. Consider adding unit and integration tests using `pytest` for better coverage and reliability.
    *   **Documentation:** While docstrings are present, a formal API documentation (e.g., using Swagger) would make the API easier to consume.
    *   **Missing Functionality:** There's no visible implementation of user registration, login, or account management beyond following/unfollowing.
    *   **Incomplete Encryption:** Code to store the encrypted data into the database, decrypt and retrieve the encrypted data from database is present. There is no code present to do the real encryption, like AES, but only SHA256 hashing

3.  **Architecture Analysis (Movement-Related Components):**

    The code does not use movement-related components.

## Readme vs Code Report
```markdown
## Documentation vs. Codebase Analysis

This document analyzes the implementation status of the Nebula Backend documentation in the provided codebase.

### General Overview

The codebase demonstrates a partial implementation of the documented features.  The API endpoints related to Prompts, Leaderboards, and Social Feeds are present as FastAPI routers and have corresponding models and schemas. However, not all documented endpoints are fully implemented, and some functionality is missing.

### Implemented Features

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   **Prompt Marketplace Endpoints:**
        *   **POST `/add-premium-prompts`:** Implemented in `app/marketplace/routes.py`.
        *   **GET `/get-premium-prompts`:** Implemented in `app/marketplace/routes.py`.
        *   **GET `/premium-prompt-filters`:** Implemented in `app/marketplace/routes.py`.
        *   **POST `/filter-premium-prompts`:** Implemented in `app/marketplace/routes.py`.
        *   **POST `/add-public-prompts`:** Implemented in `app/prompts/routes.py`.
        *   **GET `/prompt-tags`:** Implemented in `app/prompts/routes.py`.
        *   **GET `/get-public-prompts`:** Implemented in `app/prompts/routes.py`.
        *   **POST `/filter-public-prompts`:** Implemented in `app/prompts/routes.py`.
    *   **Leaderboard Endpoints:**
        *   **GET `/generations-24h`:** Implemented in `app/leaderboard/routes.py`.
        *   **GET `/streaks`:** Implemented in `app/leaderboard/routes.py`.
        *   **GET `/xp`:** Implemented in `app/leaderboard/routes.py`.
    *   **Social Feed Endpoints:**
        *   **POST `/like-prompt`:** Implemented in `app/socialfeed/routes.py`.
        *   **POST `/comment-prompt`:** Implemented in `app/socialfeed/routes.py`.
        *   **GET `/get-prompt-comments`:** Implemented in `app/socialfeed/routes.py`.
        *   **POST `/follow-creator`:** Implemented in `app/socialfeed/routes.py`.
        *   **DELETE `/unfollow-creator`:** Implemented in `app/socialfeed/routes.py`.
        *   **GET `/creator-followers`:** Implemented in `app/socialfeed/routes.py`.
        *   **GET `/user-following`:** Implemented in `app/socialfeed/routes.py`.
        *   **GET `/feed`:** Implemented in `app/socialfeed/routes.py`.
        *   **GET `/feed/followers`:** Implemented in `app/socialfeed/routes.py`.
        *   **GET `/feed/following`:** Implemented in `app/socialfeed/routes.py`.
        *   **GET `/feed/combined`:** Implemented in `app/socialfeed/routes.py`.
	    *   **GET `/prompt-likes`:** Implemented in `app/socialfeed/routes.py`.

*   **Database:**
    *   The database schema reflects the data structures described in the documentation for Prompts, User interactions and statistics. SQLAlchemy models are defined for these entities.
    *   Alembic migrations are used to manage the database schema.

*   **Dependencies:**
    *   FastAPI, SQLAlchemy are declared and used in the project.

### Missing/Not Implemented Features

*   **Automation Tasks:**
    *   The documentation mentions automation tasks. However, the provided code only includes a Celery task for finalizing challenges in `app/celery/celery.py`. Any other automation tasks described elsewhere or planned aren't implemented in the provided scope. The `BASE_URL` and `API_KEY` in the celery config suggests that the call is for another service and not part of the backend.

*   **Movement Blockchain Integration:**
    *   The documentation states that Nebula is built on the Movement blockchain. There's no explicit code for interacting directly with the Movement blockchain. The system seems to primarily manage data *related to* the blockchain, rather than actively interacting with it in the provided code. The `app/encrypt` module also suggests storing private keys, but the documentation does not explicitly mention this.

*   **Error Handling and Validation:**
    *   While the code includes basic exception handling within route functions, a comprehensive, global error handling strategy is not apparent. Input validation primarily relies on Pydantic schemas, which is good, but more detailed validation logic could be implemented.

### Key Observations

*   **Routing and Structure:** The project is well-structured, utilizing FastAPI routers to organize API endpoints by functional area (socialfeed, prompts, leaderboard, marketplace).
*   **Database Interaction:** The application uses SQLAlchemy for database interaction, including models and migrations.
*   **Dependency Management:** The `requirements.txt` file and `entrypoint.sh` script indicate that the dependencies are managed using pip.

### Recommendations

1.  **Implement Missing Endpoints:** Prioritize the implementation of any missing API endpoints from the documentation.
2.  **Clarify Blockchain Interaction:** Add explicit code for interacting with the Movement blockchain or clarify the nature of the data synchronization.
3.  **Enhance Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling and logging mechanisms.
4.  **Complete Automation Tasks:** Fully implement any additional automation tasks described in the documentation.
5.  **Complete Documentation:** Add documentations for database setup, environment variables and all the apis.
